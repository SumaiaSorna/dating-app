## Description

Crush is a dating app, where people can swipe left or right reflecting their interest, and view profiles to find out peoples intentions from the get-go. Its'intentions' feature makes it compulsory for user to state why they're using the app, from 'FlingTing' and 'Lets see where it goes', to 'Marry Me'.

This means there's no faff and pretence, rather everyone knows where they stand before engaging in a conversation.

A responsive dynamic app which will run in the browser. Crush is an easy to use application, which hold a SQL database to hold, and manage matches. The website requires direct input from the user, where the user signs up and is easily able to navigate through the site. If any 2 users swipe right on one another, this creates a match, and allows the couple to decide on a date.

## User Story

```
AS a user I expect to FIND a main page that gives me an overview of what the app is about.

I would ALSO expect to find some form of navigation on using the app, such as 'signing up' and 'logging in' buttons,

WHEN i click on either buttons, i EXPECT to be taken to a page where i can either login and be relocated to a private page or enter my details and sign up for instant use.

Ideally i would THEN like to be taken to my Profile page. WHERE i can see my matches, and HAVE the ability to update Bio at a later stage.

As a user i WOULD like to have a navbar that would give me easy access to the relevant pages, such as my profile, and the exploring options.

WHEN exploring i SHOULD be given a summary information of other users (potential matches), AND have the ability to view their profile WHEN i click on the card.

I WOULD like my first glance at the user cards to give me:

- an image
- name
- age
- location
- a short summary

The cards SHOULD give me the ability to select yes or no at a glance, as an option of matching.

If another USER has 'liked me', upon 'liking' them back i SHOULD receive a notification that we matched. I WOULD also like teh option to connect or to continue browsing.

#### APIs

##### Third Party API:

##### Restful API:

We began by defining the EndPoints of the RESTful API to be created first, EndPoints are the routes from the API that we are created.
Commonly used HTTP verbs are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

GET is used to get data from the server or better known as READ, POST is used to CREATE new data, PUT is used to UPDATE data, and DELETE is used to delete data.

Or better known as CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete).

#### Routing Table:

Here is the EndPoint design of the RESTful API that was used to create this project:
